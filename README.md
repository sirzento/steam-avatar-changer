## What is this?
**Steam Avatar Changer** is a lightweight program that automatically changes your Steam avatar.

It can be set to change your avatar every year at a certain time period.
So if you have for example a Christmas themed avatar or a party avatar for your birthday you can set this in the program and then your avatar will be changed automatically at the right time.

Furthermore, you can also set a **default avatar**. This is always used when no other time period applies.
If you have set more than one default avatar, one of them will be randomly taken.

## Features
- Steam avatar changes to configured time periods
- Default avatar if no time period applies
- Randomly selected avatar in case of multiple default avatars
- Checks for a new avatar after software startup, after each configuration change or at 11:59 p.m.

## FAQ
**Q:** Can you add discord compatibility to this software?

**A:** Sadly no. I've thought of the same idea, but unfortunately it's against Discord's terms of service to use a bot that has direct access to a user's account.

**Q:** Does this software run on linux or macos?

**A:** I haven't tested it yet, but it should run on these platforms as well I think. If you use one of these platforms, please open a new issue and tell me if everything works or if there are any problems :)

**Q:** Does this software saves my password in plain text or sends it to somewhere else?

**A:** No, this program does not save passwords or send them to others, except to the official Steam servers for login. What is saved is the session, and if necessary the Steam Guard handle.
With the session, the software can authenticate again with the Steam servers and authorize with the Steam Guard handle, so that the Steam Guard code does not have to be entered again.

On logout, the data of the session and the Steam Guard handle are deleted.
